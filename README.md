from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
def get_root():
    return{"Hello": World"}

    //router is the main, give it input and just run it??
    //what is the uvicorn doing? is it like a library, I didn't realize it was an IDE like visual studio??
    //a thread is another entry, operating system
    //thread, text input, visual studio 
    //are uvicorn and fastapi like libraries working together to allow us to create the web server, can it work separately?


    //running locally 
    //is the 8000 the local port thing? yes
    //talks on separate ports
    //flask is a toy,
    //better than many
    //browser is an app

QUESTIONS:
//why do  we pick the 127, is it arbitrary? if not where does it come from ?
    //server.py and told fastapi u wanted to do it, uvicorn is the app?? (run it on the app then???)
    //@ symbols are decorators, a function saying whenever the function gets called, do this
    instead of function within a function, use @??
    //ask about infinite prime code... whats the largest it can be??? how does type casting work in python?? should i divide by these things and turn them into floats and divide into floats??
//also where does run come from
